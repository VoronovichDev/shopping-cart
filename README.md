# HOMEMADE GYM
____
HomeMade Gym is a mock online-shop. In this project I used and practice **React, React-router, Redux, React-redux, Redux-toolkit**. At first I wrote this shop with createStore, actionTypes, actionCreators and reducer. To connect components with store I used connect-hoc. When I finished, I gradually began to implement the functionality of redux-tookit and react-redux hooks. I ended up putting business logic layer in a shopping-slice. This process can be traced through the commit history
____
The purpose of this project, whose description you will find here - [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart), is to make an online store mock and practice routing. As already said I also added and used redux, react-redux and redux-toolkit
